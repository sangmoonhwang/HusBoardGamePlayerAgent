# HusBoardGamePlayerAgent
It is an artificial intelligent agent playing HusBoardGame
The agent is currently utilizing Best-first search and Min-Max algorithm.
Due to the game rule which gives only 2 seconds for each turn, I tried to make the agent as simple and compact as possible.
However, there are a lot of options to still improve the capability of the agent.

# Improvement
- The agent could be improved by implementing Alpha-Beta pruning
- Employing Monte-Carlo search tree would be another good option to improve the agent.
